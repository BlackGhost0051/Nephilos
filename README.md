## Fragments

### Wifi Scanner

The Wifi Scanner fragment scans and displays available Wi-Fi networks, giving insights into nearby access points.

Features include:

```
SSID: Network name.
BSSID: Access pointâ€™s MAC address.
Signal Strength: Measured in dBm.
Encryption: Encryption type (e.g., WPA2, WEP).
Frequency: Channel frequency in GHz (e.g., 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands).
```

### Mac Scanner

The Mac Scanner identifies devices on the local network by their MAC addresses and displays relevant device information. This is useful for discovering connected devices within the subnet.

- Command Used: `su -c ip n show`
- Output: Lists all devices on the network with details on MAC addresses and current statuses.

### Port Scanner

The Port Scanner fragment allows users to scan TCP ports on a target IP address to check for open or closed TCP ports.

### Send Request

The Send Request fragment facilitates sending HTTP requests to a specified URL. It allows users to specify request methods (GET, POST) and view the server response.

### Arp Spoof

TEST

The Arp Spoof fragment enables ARP spoofing on the local network, allowing users to intercept traffic between devices by spoofing their ARP responses.


### DNS Lookup

TEST

The DNS Lookup fragment allows users to perform DNS queries to resolve domain names to IP addresses.

### Settings

The Settings fragment manages application settings and preferences, allowing users to configure preferences.
